# App Icon Instructions

## Replacing the App Icon

1. The app icon has been renamed from "SmolVLM logo.png" to "SnapECG logo.png", but still needs a design update.

2. Replace the file `HuggingSnap/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/SnapECG logo.png` with a new heart-themed icon.

3. The icon should be a red heart on a white background or a heart ECG design in the same style as the current app design.

4. Icon requirements:
   - 1024x1024 pixels
   - PNG format
   - 72 DPI
   - sRGB color profile
   - No alpha/transparency

5. The file reference in Contents.json has already been updated to "SnapECG logo.png".

## Icon Design Suggestions

Consider using:
- A red heart icon with an ECG trace across it
- A medical-themed heart symbol 
- A heart with an integrated waveform
- Clean design with minimal details for recognition at small sizes

The app icon should convey the app's purpose: ECG analysis with a focus on cardiac health.
